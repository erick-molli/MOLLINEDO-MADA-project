# Supplementary Material

The following document includes some of the results from the exploratory data analysis.

## Supplementary Results

@fig-conc shows the summary of concentrations for each chemical species categorized by study arm. It is observed a similar pattern observed from the categorization by type of fuel, where Mg, Mn, Ca, K, BC, Ti, Si and S have statistically significant differences in concentrations (shown as \*\*\*\*).

![Chemical species concentrations by study arm](../../../results/figures/boxplot-arm.png){#fig-conc}

In terms of the categorical exposures @fig-cat summarizes the responses from all the exposures. It is observed that for the incence and generator variables there were just a few or none observations that recorded being exposed to these sources. Meanwhile, stove usage was the exposure most recorded.

The following figures show the distribution of the concentrations of Carbon monoxide (@fig-co) and PM~2.5~ (@fig-pm), which were considered as covariates (CO) or independent variables (PM~2.5~) to be included in the modelling process with the categorical exposures.

![PM2.5 concentrations by type of fuel](../../../results/figures/pm25.png){#fig-pm}

The following tables show the model summaries for the final models selected. In this case the linear regression model for the PM~2.5~ mass concentrations and the gamma GLM model for the BC mass concentrations.

print(results_bcglm)

The following figures illustrate the observed vs predicted values plots for both PM~2.5~ and BC models, and the residual plots.
