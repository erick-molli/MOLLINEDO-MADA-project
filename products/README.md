The `products` folder contains the `manuscript` and `slides` subfolders.

Under the `manuscript` subfolder, there is a Quarto document where I will be working each part of the project. The files will be saved in .docx format and will be named with Myname_project_Partnumber.docx. So for right now, Part 1 of the project is saved as `Erick_project_Part1.docx`.
