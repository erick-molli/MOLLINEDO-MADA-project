The `products` folder contains the `manuscript` and `slides` subfolders.

Under the `manuscript` subfolder, there is a Quarto document where I will be working each part of the project. The files will be saved in .docx format and will be named with Myname_project_Partnumber.docx. The following files are located right now:
`Erick_project_Part1.docx` as Part 1 of the project.
`Erick_project_Part2.docx` as Project Part 2 and
`Manuscript` which will be changed between Project Parts 3 to 6.

Under the `supplement` folder inside `manuscript`, it is located the Quarto document that produces the Supplementary analysis document. The Supplementary Material document is located as a Word file named `Supplementary`.
