# Overview

The code subfolder contains all the codes needed for data cleaning and analysis:

1.The `data_cleaning_code.qmd` file contains all the code used to manipulate or 'clean' the data that I used for posterior analyses. The output can be seen as an html file. This is under the `processing` subfolder.

2.The `data_exploring_code.qmd` file contains all the code used for initial data exploration to make decisions for posterior analyses. The output can be seen as an html file. This is under the `eda` subfolder.

3.The `data_analysis_code.qmd` file has all the code for the main statistical analyses. It is the final code for the manuscript. This is under the `analysis` subfolder.
