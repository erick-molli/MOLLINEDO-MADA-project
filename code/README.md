# Overview

The code subfolder contains all the codes needed for data cleaning and analysis:

1.The data_cleaning_code.qmd file contains all the code used to manipulate or 'clean' the data that I used for posterior analyses. The output can be seen as an html file.

2.The data_exploring_code.qmd file contains all the code used for initial data exploration to make decisions for posterior analyses. The output can be seen as an html file.

3.The data_analysis_code.qmd file has the previous steps (data cleaning and data exploring), and the main statistical analyses. This code may likely to change ti reflect changes in the data cleaning script.
