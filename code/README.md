# Overview

The code subfolder contains all the codes needed for data cleaning and analysis:

1.The data_cleaning_code.qmd file contains all the code used to manipulate or 'clean' the data that I used for posterior analyses. The output can be seen as an html file. This code may likely change slightly to produce more changes into the data before analysis.

2.The data_exploring_code.qmd file contains all the code used for initial data exploration to make decisions for posterior analyses. The output can be seen as an html file. This code may likely change to reflect changes in the data cleaning script.
