This data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the `code` folders.

The `raw_data` folder contains the raw data to be used for the data analysis and coding. These data sould not be edited ever.

Under `raw_data` so far, there is one data file:

1. The `conc_unc_hapingt_emollinedo.xlsx` file is an excel format spreadsheet that contains the XRF determined concentrations of the 648 personal sample filters for 24 elemental species, this is located under the 'Concentration' tab. Under the 'Uncertainty' tab, there are the XRF instrument determined uncertainties of the same 648 personal sample filters. In the 'DL' tab, the detection limits for each one of the elemental species are listed, these were determined by the XRF instrumentation.
