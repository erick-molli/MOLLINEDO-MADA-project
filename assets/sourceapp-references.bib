	abstract = {Efforts to understand and mitigate the health effects of particulate matter (PM) air pollution have a rich and interesting history. This review focuses on six substantial lines of research that have been pursued since 1997 that have helped elucidate our understanding about the effects of PM on human health. There has been substantial progress in the evaluation of PM health effects at different time-scales of exposure and in the exploration of the shape of the concentration-response function. There has also been emerging evidence of PM-related cardiovascular health effects and growing knowledge regarding interconnected general pathophysiological pathways that link PM exposure with cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality. Despite important gaps in scientiﬁc knowledge and continued reasons for some skepticism, a comprehensive evaluation of the research ﬁndings provides persuasive evidence that exposure to ﬁne particulate air pollution has adverse effects on cardiopulmonary health. Although much of this research has been motivated by environmental public health policy, these results have important scientiﬁc, medical, and public health implications that are broader than debates over legally mandated air quality standards.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally, nearly 3 billion people rely on solid fuels for cooking and heating, the vast majority residing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The resulting household air pollution (HAP) is a leading environmental risk factor, accounting for an estimated 1.6 million premature deaths annually. Previous interventions of cleaner stoves have often failed to reduce exposure to levels that produce meaningful health improvements. There have been no multicountry ﬁeld trials with liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG) stoves, likely the cleanest scalable intervention.
OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the design and methods of an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) of LPG stove and fuel distribution in 3,200 households in 4 LMICs (India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda).
METHODS: We are enrolling 800 pregnant women at each of the 4 international research centers from households using biomass fuels. We are randomly assigning households to receive LPG stoves, an 18-month supply of free LPG, and behavioral reinforcements to the control arm. The mother is being followed along with her child until the child is 1 year old. Older adult women (40 to {\textless}80 years of age) living in the same households are also enrolled and followed during the same period. Primary health outcomes are low birth weight, severe pneumonia incidence, stunting in the child, and high blood pressure (BP) in the older adult woman. Secondary health outcomes are also being assessed. We are assessing stove and fuel use, conducting repeated personal and kitchen exposure assessments of ﬁne particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2:5 lm (PM2:5), carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon (BC), and collecting dried blood spots (DBS) and urinary samples for biomarker analysis. Enrollment and data collection began in May 2018 and will continue through August 2021. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02944682).
CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide evidence to inform national and global policies on scaling up LPG stove use among vulnerable populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6407},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High quality personal exposure data is fundamental to understanding the health implications of household energy interventions, interpreting analyses across assigned study arms, and characterizing exposure–response relationships for household air pollution. This paper describes the exposure data collection for the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN), a multicountry randomized controlled trial of liqueﬁed petroleum gas stoves and fuel among 3,200 households in India, Rwanda, Guatemala, and Peru.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of the exposure assessment are to estimate the exposure contrast achieved following a clean fuel intervention and to provide data for analyses of exposure–response relationships across a range of personal exposures.
METHODS: Exposure measurements are being conducted over the 3-y time frame of the ﬁeld study. We are measuring ﬁne particulate matter [PM {\textless} 2:5 lm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2:5)] with the Enhanced Children’s MicroPEM™ (RTI International), carbon monoxide (CO) with the USB-EL-CO (Lascar Electronics), and black carbon with the OT21 transmissometer (Magee Scientiﬁc) in pregnant women, adult women, and children {\textless}1 year of age, primarily via multiple 24-h personal assessments (three, six, and three measurements, respectively) over the course of the 18month follow-up period using lightweight monitors. For children we are using an indirect measurement approach, combining data from area monitors and locator devices worn by the child. For a subsample (up to 10\%) of the study population, we are doubling the frequency of measurements in order to estimate the accuracy of subject-speciﬁc typical exposure estimates. In addition, we are conducting ambient air monitoring to help characterize potential contributions of PM2:5 exposure from background concentration. Stove use monitors (Geocene) are being used to assess compliance with the intervention, given that stove stacking (use of traditional stoves in addition to the intervention gas stove) may occur.
CONCLUSIONS: The tools and approaches being used for HAPIN to estimate personal exposures build on previous eﬀorts and take advantage of new technologies. In addition to providing key personal exposure data for this study, we hope the application and learnings from our exposure assessment will help inform future eﬀorts to characterize exposure to household air pollution and for other contexts. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6422},

	abstract = {Household air pollution in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing regions is an important cause of disease burden. Little is known about the chemical composition and sources of household air pollution in subSaharan Africa, and how they diﬀer between rural and urban homes. We analyzed the chemical composition and sources of ﬁne particles (PM2.5) in household cooking areas of multiple neighborhoods in Accra, Ghana, and in peri-urban (Banjul) and rural (Basse) areas in The Gambia. In Accra, biomass burning accounted for 39−62\% of total PM2.5 mass in the cooking area in diﬀerent neighborhoods; the absolute contributions were 10−45 μg/m3. Road dust and vehicle emissions comprised 12−33\% of PM2.5 mass. Solid waste burning was also a signiﬁcant contributor to household PM2.5 in a low-income neighborhood but not for those living in better-oﬀ areas. In Banjul and Basse, biomass burning was the single dominant source of cooking-area PM2.5, accounting for 74−87\% of its total mass; the relative and absolute contributions of biomass smoke to PM2.5 mass were larger in households that used ﬁrewood than in those using charcoal, reaching as high as 463 μg/m3 in Basse homes that used ﬁrewood for cooking. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the need for policies that enhance access to cleaner fuels in both rural and urban areas, and for controlling traﬃc emissions in cities in sub-Saharan Africa.},

Numerous procedural decisions must be made and algorithmic parameters selected when analyzing PM data with PMF. However, few publications document enough of these details for readers to evaluate, reproduce, or compare results between different studies. For example, few studies document why some species were used and others not used in the modeling, how the number of factors was selected, or how much uncertainty exists in the solutions. More thorough documentation will aid the development of standard protocols for analyzing PM data with PMF and will reveal more clearly where research is needed to help future analysts select from the various possible procedures and parameters available in PMF. For example, research likely is needed to determine optimal approaches for handling data below detection limits, ways to apportion PM mass among sources identiﬁed by PMF, and ways to estimate uncertainties in the solution. The review closes with recommendations for documenting the methodological details of future PMF analyses.},

	abstract = {The Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA) in Northeast Mexico has shown high PM2.5 concentrations since 2003. The data shows that the annual average concentration exceeds from 2 to 3 times the Mexican PM2.5 annual air quality standard of 12 µg/m3. In a previous work we studied the chemical characterization of PM2.5 in two sites of the MMA during the winter season. Among the most important components we found ammonium sulfate and nitrate, elemental and organic carbon, and crustal matter. In this work we present the results of a second chemical characterization study performed during the summer time and the application of the chemical mass balance (CMB) model to determine the source apportionment of air pollutants in the region. The chemical analysis results show that the chemical composition of PM2.5 is similar in both sites and periods of the year. The results of the chemical analysis and the CMB model show that industrial, traffic, and combustion activities in the area are the major sources of primary PM2.5 and precursor gases of secondary inorganic and organic aerosol (SO2, NOx, NH3, and volatile organic compounds [VOCs]). We also found that black carbon and organic carbon are important components of PM2.5 in the MMA. These results are consistent with the MMA emission inventory that reports as major sources of particles and SO2 a refinery and fuel combustion, as well as nitrogen oxides and ammonium from transportation and industrial activities in the MMA and ammonium form agricultural activities in the state. The results of this work are important to identify and support effective actions to reduce direct emissions of PM2.5 and its precursor gases to improve air quality in the MMA.},

Complete source proﬁles are required to be assessed for implementation of proper mitigation measures over the NCR. In this study, emission sources of PM2.5 are reported for the NCR of India for samples collected during December 2016 to December 2017 at three sampling sites in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Organic constituents (n-alkanes, isoprenoid hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalates, levoglucosan and n-alkanoic acids) in PM2.5 were measured to apportion the sources over the study area. Source apportionment of PM2.5 was performed using organic constituents by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Health risk associated with organic pollutants [PAHs and carcinogen BEHP bis(2ethylhexyl) phthalate] demonstrated the threat of PM2.5 exposure via inhalation. Transport pathways of air masses were evaluated using 3-day backward trajectories and observed that some air masses originated from local sources along with long-range transport which inﬂuenced the PAHs concentration during most of the study period over the NCR. PMF and PCA resulted in the ﬁve major emission sources [vehicular emissions (32.2\%), biomass burning (30\%), cooking emissions (16.8\%), plastic burning (13.4\%), mixed sources (7.6\%) including biogenic and industrial emissions] for PM2.5 over the sampling sites. The present study reveals that transport sector is a major source to be targeted to reduce the vehicular emissions and consequent health risks associated with organic pollutants especially PAHs.},

Multi-complexity in location and type of industrial units along with haphazard traffic system are some of the major challenges in resolving relative source contribution with higher significance, especially in case of indoor and personal level air quality. On the basis of questionnaire survey that include daily activity pattern with use of household cooking fuel by local residents, three fuel categories identified: 1) Use of Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) stove, 2) Use of kerosene stoves and electric stoves and 3) Conventional stoves using coke and cow dung cakes. In many of middle class residents, kitchen cooking is depending on all three categorized fuels. A longitudinal measurements of respirable particulate matter (RPM) in residential-indoors, ambient-outdoors of selected source sites and local-outdoor of road-traffic junctions have been monitored during October–December 2009. Sampling frequency was ten (twice in a week). Chemical Mass Balance (CMB8) was executed using source-routes and indoor-receptor compositional profiles. Results have shown significant variation in relative contributions of outdoor sources with potential impact of household fuel emission on source contributions of indoor RPM. Results also explained extent of contribution from roadtraffic emissions, local soils and major industrial complex to indoor RPM levels.},
