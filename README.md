# Overview

This is Erick Mollinedo's class project repository.

## Template structure

* All data goes into the subfolders inside the `data` folder.
* All code goes into the `code` folder or subfolders.
* All results (figures, tables, computed values) go into `results` folder or subfolders.
* All products (manuscripts, supplement, presentation slides, web apps, etc.) go into `products` subfolders.
* The `renv` folder is automatically generated by the `renv` package, and is
used to keep track of packages.
* See the various `README.md` files in those folders for some more information.

## To Run the script

To run the analyses, I placed all the code chunks under the `code` folder. There should be one file for data cleaning `data_cleaning_code.qmd`, one for exploratory analysis `data_exploring_code.qmd` and one for the statistical analyses `data_analysis_code.qmd`. The codes must me run in the exact same order as listed here, once, and after doing that, if there is a need to inspect each process, each code can be run sepparately, since the files as inputs will be generated from the first run.
