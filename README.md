# Overview

This is Erick Mollinedo's class project repository.

## Template structure

* All data goes into the subfolders inside the `data` folder.
* All code goes into the `code` folder or subfolders.
* All results (figures, tables, computed values) go into `results` folder or subfolders.
* All products (manuscripts, supplement, presentation slides, web apps, etc.) go into `products` subfolders.
* The `renv` folder is automatically generated by the `renv` package, and is
used to keep track of packages.
* See the various `README.md` files in those folders for some more information.

## To Run the script

To run the whole analysis, I placed all the code chunks under the `data_analysis_code.qmd` file under the `code` folder. This file should run smoothly if running the chunks in order. For a more descriptive detail on the data cleaning/exploratory analysis there are separate files under the `code` folder.
